This program is a subtractive synthesizer instrument made by myself in Oct 2021. 

The instrument was coded by Faust, a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing. It has three blocks of sounds that a user can generate, just like the virtual synthesizer software "serum." It includes two oscillators of basic shapes (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth), a block of the noise generator, and three groups of effects. Users could choose the sounds they want by doing a combination of the three blocks.

The dsp file can be uploaded and run in Faust IDE (faustide.grame.fr). 
In Faust IDE, it can be exported into a JUCE program.
